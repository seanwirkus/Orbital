# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Orbital v2.0

## Welcome to the Unified Interface!

Everything you need is now in **one place** with **three simple tabs**.

---

## 📋 Tab Overview

### ✏️ Tab 1: Draw
**Draw and explore molecules**
- Click to place atoms
- Drag between atoms to create bonds
- Use ring templates for quick structures
- See properties update in real-time
- Click "🧪 Use in Reaction →" to move to simulation

### 🧪 Tab 2: Simulate Reaction
**Run your own reactions - simplified workflow!**

**Step 1: Draw Reactant(s)**
- Draw your starting molecule on the left canvas
- Click "✅ Save Reactant" to add it
- Draw multiple reactants if needed

**Step 2: Choose Reagent**
- Select from 30+ reagents in the dropdown
- **See instant info** about what it does:
  - What reaction it performs
  - Required conditions (heat, pressure, etc.)
  - Mechanism type
- Click "View detailed mechanism →" to jump to mechanisms tab

**Step 3: Product**
- Click "🔮 Auto-Predict Product" (AI-assisted)
- OR click "✏️ Draw Manually" to draw it yourself
- Export your complete reaction!

### 📊 Tab 3: Learn Mechanisms
**Browse 11 reaction mechanisms with animated electron flow**

**Left Sidebar**: Click any mechanism to view
- Elimination (E1, E2)
- Substitution (SN1, SN2)
- Addition, Oxidation, Reduction
- Advanced (Aldol, Grob, Hydrolysis)

**Main Display**: Interactive SVG diagrams
- Color-coded electron arrows
- Step-by-step progression
- Play button for animation
- Export as SVG

## 🎯 Quickest Way to Simulate a Reaction

1. **Draw Tab**: Draw your molecule → click "🧪 Use in Reaction →"
2. **Simulate Tab**: Already populated! → Pick a reagent → See live info
3. Choose "Auto-Predict" or "Draw Manually"
4. Export your result!

**That's it! No modals, no complex workflows.**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### In Draw Tab:
- **Auto-connect**: Carbon atoms automatically bond to nearby carbons
- **Templates**: Use benzene/cyclohexane for quick ring structures
- **Organize**: Click 🪄 to auto-arrange messy molecules

### In Simulate Tab:
- **Live Reagent Info**: Shows exactly what each reagent does
- **Direct Link**: Click "View detailed mechanism" to see the full arrow-pushing
- **Save Multiple**: Add multiple reactants for multi-component reactions

### In Mechanisms Tab:
- **Search**: Use the search box to find specific reactions
- **Categories**: Organized by reaction type for easy browsing
- **Animation**: Click ▶️ to watch electron flow step-by-step

## 🎨 What's Different from V1?

### Before (V1):
- ❌ Separate modals for reactions and mechanisms
- ❌ Complex multi-step workflow with save buttons
- ❌ Had to close/reopen windows
- ❌ Reagent info hidden until you start

### Now (V2):
- ✅ Everything in **one window, three tabs**
- ✅ Simple left-to-right workflow
- ✅ **Live reagent info** as you select
- ✅ Direct links between tabs
- ✅ Easier to compare reactant/product side-by-side
- ✅ No modals blocking your view

## 📸 Example Workflow

**Want to see E2 elimination?**

1. Tab 2 (Simulate): Draw 2-bromopropane
2. Select reagent: **t-BuOK**
3. See live info: "E2 Elimination → Forms alkenes, Heat (Δ)"
4. Click "View detailed mechanism"
5. Tab 3 (Mechanisms): Shows full E2 mechanism with arrows!

**Done in 60 seconds!**
