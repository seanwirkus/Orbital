# Instructions for Organic Chemistry Visualizer and Simulator

## Overall App Function

The primary function of the app is to serve as an interactive organic chemistry visualizer and simulator. Key capabilities include:

- **Drawing Molecular Structures**: Allow users to draw carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds and other bonds between atoms.
- **Bond Type Adjustment**: Enable users to adjust bond types, including single, double, and triple bonds.
- **Element Support**: Include support for essential elements such as:
  - Carbon (C)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Oxygen (O)
  - Hydrogen (H)
  - Halogens: Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Iodine (I)
  - Potentially other common organic chemistry elements (e.g., Sulfur (S), Phosphorus (P))

## Additional Features to Consider

- **Atom Placement**: Intuitive interface for placing atoms on a canvas or grid.
- **Bond Creation**: Tools to connect atoms with appropriate bonds.
- **Molecular Editing**: Ability to modify, delete, or move atoms and bonds.
- **Visualization**: Clear graphical representation of molecules with proper atomic symbols and bond notations.
- **Simulation Aspects**: Basic simulation features such as calculating molecular formulas, displaying 3D structures (if applicable), or simple reaction simulations.
- **User Interface**: Toolbar for selecting elements, bond types, and tools; canvas area for drawing; property panels for displaying information.

## Development Guidelines

- Ensure the app is user-friendly and educational for chemistry students or professionals.
- Implement responsive design for web-based deployment.
- Consider accessibility features for broader usability.
- Plan for extensibility to add more advanced features in the future.
